MemReport Parser
================
Parse UE4 MemReport files to see memory usage over time. For instance do a MemReport on
the Main Menu, load a level, go back to the Main Menu and do another MemReport. Repeat
as many times as you like. You can then spot any memory usage increase which would indicate
a memory or resource leak.
